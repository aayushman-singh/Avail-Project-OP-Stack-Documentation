# Avail-Project-OP-Stack-Docs

This repository contains feedback and documentation improvements for the Avail Project's OP Stack Documentation. The goal was to test the OP Stack setup thoroughly and document any issues, missing steps, or improvements that could enhance user experience and accuracy in the instructions.

## Project Overview

The task involved going through the entire setup and deployment process of the Avail OP Stack to ensure that every step works as intended. Throughout this process, I documented my findings, provided suggestions, and left feedback in a modified version of the official documentation. 

### Structure

1. **Screenshots**:  
   To provide visual clarity on each step, I took screenshots during each major stage of the setup. These screenshots are organized in folders, each named after the specific heading or section they correspond to within the documentation. This makes it easy to reference the exact location in the docs and verify each step visually.

2. **PDF Compilation**:  
   For easier access and review, I compiled all screenshots for each section into individual PDFs. Each PDF is placed within its respective section folder, alongside the original screenshots. This provides both a quick reference option (PDF) and the flexibility to view individual screenshots as needed.

3. **Feedback Notes**:  
   I've added detailed notes directly into a modified version of the documentation (feedback.md). These notes highlight issues I encountered, provide suggestions for improvement, and clarify steps that may need further detail. The modified docs serve as both feedback for the maintainers and an enhanced guide for future users.

4. **GIFS**:
    I made a couple gifs of the project in its working state as well as it can't be captured properly in screenshots.

## Contribution and Experience

Iâ€™m happy to have had the opportunity to contribute to the Avail Project by testing and refining the OP Stack documentation. It was a valuable experience working with the stack from start to finish, and I enjoyed identifying areas that could improve clarity for other users. This project was both challenging and rewarding, and I hope my feedback makes a meaningful difference in enhancing the usability of the Avail OP Stack documentation.
